    <header><a href="http://markolson.github.io/storyboard/">Storyboard</a></header>
    <p>Storyboard builds PDFs and GIFs from your video files. I had this weird dream of not needing to 
    <em>watch</em> TV, but of being able to read it, and so now I read Seinfeld. </p>
    <p>Also Night of the Living Derad.</p>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/notld.gif" /></p>
    <p>I've got a page over  <a href="http://markolson.github.io/storyboard/">at github</a> that talks more about this and has a link to Night of the Living Dead as a PDF.</p>
    <p>I wrote about some of Storyboard's development <a href="http://localhost:4000/2013/01/20/storyboard/">here</a> and <a href="http://localhost:4000/2013/02/03/storyboard-updates-now-with-gifs-and-unicode/">here</a>. I'm currently
    working on a rewrite, hoping to make it more accessable to non-technical users.</p>

<div class="box">
    <header><a href="http://howmanydaysuntilarresteddevelopmentisback.com">How Many Days Until Arrested Development Is Back?</a></header>
    <p>It did what it said on the tin - counting down to Arrested Development's return while playing
    some Journey</p>

    <header><a href="http://twitter.com/doinkdoink">@doinkdoink</a></header>
    <p>My favorite weekend project that turned into a seemingly never ending journey of web scraping, 
    data validation, and time zone reckoning, <a href="http://twitter.com/doinkdoink">@doinkdoink</a> tweets
    out a few minutes before any episodes of any the Law &amp; Order series airs on a major US network.</p>
    <p>It has more followers than I'm comfortable with.</p>

<div class="box">
    <header><a href="http://twitter.com/qwantz">@qwantz</a></header>
    <p>A super quick twitter bot that replies with T-Rex lines from <a href="http://qwantz.com">Dinosaur Comics</a>. Sometimes he talks to himself, though.</p>

<div class="box">
    <header><a href="https://github.com/markolson/MLB-Menu">MLB-Menu</a></header>
    <p>MLB Menu is a small, simple little mac app that reads in some JSON from MLB to show the current games, their scores, and give you quick access to the Gameday pages by clickingon them. It's these sorts of little programs and scripts, that provide some quick payoff and tangable benefit, that remind me how much I like programming sometimes.</p>
