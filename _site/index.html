            </h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In my heart of hearts, I&#39;m a &#39;printf&#39; debugger, where my first solution to any
problem is just throwing godawful amounts of <code>puts</code> in Ruby, <code>print</code>s in Python,
<code>IO.inspect</code>s in Elixir,  <code>console.log</code> in Javascript, and whatever else I can
do to generate a wall of text saying &quot;OK HERE NOW&quot; or &quot;IT WORKED! GOT TO STEP 3&quot;.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, this doesn&#39;t always work, and that&#39;s where things like
<code>pry</code> in Ruby come in. Elixir also has a <code>pry</code> command, which is pretty simple
to use.</p>

<h2>Pry-Debugging</h2>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="elixir"><span class="kn">require</span> <span class="no">IEx</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="no">IEx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pry</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that&#39;s it. As far as I&#39;m aware IEx&#39;s pry doesn&#39;t support any of the extra
commands that Ruby&#39;s pry does (like <code>whereami</code>, <code>find-method</code>, etc...) but at
least you can get a peek of what all the local variables in a method are. Which
is super useful.</p>

<p>To get Elixir&#39;s pry working you have to run the script through IEx with using
the <code>-s</code> flag. For tests, this means instead of <code>mix test</code> you do
<code>iex -S mix test</code>. When the execution hits the <code>IEx.pry</code> call, IEx will prompt
asking</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">  Request to pry #PID&lt;0.315.0&gt; at test/pry_test.exs:8. Allow? [Yn]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once running, you&#39;ll be in a shell where you can access the local variables and
inspect them or pass them around to different functions. Unfortunately, after a
minute you&#39;ll get this error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">     ** (ExUnit.TimeoutError) test timed out after 60000ms. You can change the timeout:

       1. per test by setting &quot;@tag timeout: x&quot;
       2. per case by setting &quot;@moduletag timeout: x&quot;
       3. globally via &quot;ExUnit.start(timeout: x)&quot; configuration
       4. or set it to infinity per run by calling &quot;mix test --trace&quot;
          (useful when using IEx.pry)

     Timeouts are given as integers in milliseconds.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Thankfully, this explains what to do: Just change the command to
<code>iex -S mix test --trace</code> and you&#39;ll avoid the timeout. Elixir&#39;s docs can really
be ðŸ’¯ sometimes. When you&#39;re done using IEx&#39;s pry, enter <code>respawn</code> in the
console to continue where the program left off.</p>

<h2>Profiling</h2>

<p>Elixir 1.1 added the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/v1.1/mix/Mix.Tasks.Profile.Fprof.html">Fprof</a>
mix task, which formats profiling code a bit nicer than the default Erlang
formatting. It&#39;s easy enough to use the wrapper method that the mix task uses to
profile whatever snippet of code you want:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="elixir">  <span class="no">Mix</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Tasks</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Profile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Fprof</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">profile</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="no">YourModule</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">method</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">end</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">sort:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;own&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">callers:</span> <span class="no">true</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The last param is the keyword list of arguments, which you are described in the
docs for the Fprof mix task. I would like this to provide some more options so
that it&#39;s more in line with <code>ruby-prof</code>, which can output in different formats
so that it can be used by other tools, so hopefully someone else works on that
before it becomes an itch that I have to scratch.</p>

<p>Anywho, I hope this helps you debug and optimize your stuff, weary Elixir
searcher</p>

                <a href="/2014/08/22/embedding-raw-data-in-graphite-renders">Embedding Raw Data in Graphite Renders</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p><img src="/assets/media/graphite-embedding/render.png" /></p>

<p>How you take snapshots of single metric charts, or, entire dashboards, is an interesting problem to me. Because the raw metrics are eventually rolled up into larger and larger aggregations before being dropped entirely, if something &#39;interesting&#39; happens that you&#39;ll want to reference for the future, you have to export the raw data - the image just won&#39;t do. While the image can be reconstructed using the raw data, the opposite isn&#39;t true. I can squint at the image above trying to figure out what the current was at 13:30, but that&#39;s a fools errand.</p>

<p>As it happens, it&#39;s not terribly difficult to get Graphite to store the raw metrics along with the rendered image. The above image was rendered by Graphite with <a href="https://gist.github.com/markolson/ecd6e46a9bea9878b3d1#file-embed-patch">this small patch</a> applied to it. It&#39;s also pretty simple to make a <a href="https://gist.github.com/markolson/ecd6e46a9bea9878b3d1#file-parser-rb">simple PNG parser</a> that can pull out data in <code>tEXt</code> chunks, getting the metric name and timeseries points. Of course, running <code>strings</code> on the file can get you that as well, since it&#39;s stored in plain text.</p>

<p>I have no idea if this is actually useful, but there&#39;s something appealing to me about being able to more easily keep raw data with visualizations. I doubt that I&#39;ll clean this up and make it into an actual PR for Graphite - the dependency on PIL is a bit much for such a small thing, and even though PNG is simple enough that you could drop the right bytes in with some string manipulation, that feels too dirty to actually do. Still, I like this idea.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/blob/master/docs/releases/0_9_13.rst">0.9.3 release</a> of Graphite, I got a quick patch in for a small problem that stopped me from doing something I&#39;d wanted for a bit - adding error thresholds on charts. While I love having my email and chat slammed with threshold alerts, I&#39;ve also thought it would be nice to see a historical perspective of those thresholds in the charts. The end solution is decidedly <em>not</em> pretty, but it&#39;s functional and gives me something useful to look at.</p>

<p>To start, I&#39;d have a normal chart showing something getting measured. I&#39;d separately have threshold alerts on this, either collecting the metric independently or pulling json data from graphite.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> render?target=alias(metric.name, &#39;data&#39;)&amp;yMin=0&amp;yMax=100
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/assets/media/graphite-error-bands/render-1.png" /></p>

<p>What the triggered alerts didn&#39;t easily show me was if there was any pattern to the metric crossing that threshold - was it correlated with another metric? a time of day? They could show me timestamps of a few past events, but that was it. With <code>constantLine</code>, I could overlay a simple line at a y-value that lined up with the &#39;danger&#39; and &#39;critical&#39; thresholds the alerts were sent out at. Zooming out on a chart like this, I could eyeball patterns or add additional metrics to look for correlations.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">render?target=alias(metric.name, &#39;data&#39;)&amp;yMin=0&amp;yMax=100
&amp;target=alias(color(constantLine(75), &#39;yellow&#39;), &#39;danger&#39;)
&amp;target=alias(color(constantLine(90), &#39;red&#39;), &#39;error&#39;)
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/assets/media/graphite-error-bands/render-2.png" /></p>

<p>While that works, the lines can get lost if there are lots of metrics, and the yellow line isn&#39;t the greatest. Graphite has <code>areaBetween</code>, which lets you set a background color (and label) that goes between 2 other metrics, and that&#39;s exactly what I wanted. Before 0.9.13, trying to use <code>areaBetween</code> with <code>constantLine</code>s failed with a bit of a cryptic (to an end-user) error. Eventually I dug in, <a href="https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/pull/897/files">made a patch</a> and happily got it accepted, letting me make my silly charts. I used a nameless <code>alias</code> in this because to me, the meaning of yellow and red backgrounds is known, whereas the <code>constantLine</code>s alone could be misinterpreted as metrics.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">render?target=alias(metric.name, &#39;data&#39;)&amp;yMin=0&amp;yMax=100
&amp;target=alpha(color(alias(areaBetween(group(constantLine(70),constantLine(90))),&quot;&quot;),&quot;yellow&quot;),0.5)
&amp;target=alpha(color(alias(areaBetween(group(constantLine(90),constantLine(100))),&quot;&quot;),&quot;red&quot;),0.5)
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/assets/media/graphite-error-bands/render-3.png" /></p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;ve got my ranges now and dipped my toe into contributing to the Graphite project. Open source is neat.</p>

                <a href="/2014/03/01/graphite-relay">Setting Up Carbon Relay For Graphite</a>
            </h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>As part of a recent project at work, we&#39;ve wanted to take metrics that different systems (each made up of multipe nodes) gather and use locally to a central store where we can monitor and compare different systems. I knew <em>of</em> <code>graphite-relay</code> and I had a notional idea of how it worked, but because of Graphite&#39;s charmingly incomplete documentation, I wasn&#39;t sure how to actually set it up. </p>

<p>The key to my understanding of getting <code>carbon-relay</code> working was realizing that <code>carbon-relay</code> transmits pickled data, not raw metrics. Given a local <code>carbon</code> instance on <code>localhost</code>, and a remote one that we want to copy the results to at <code>stat-sink.corp</code>, you&#39;d start by modifying <code>carbon-relay.conf</code> and setting the destinations.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">[default]
default = true
destinations = stat-sink.corp:2014, 127.0.0.1:2014
</code></pre></div>
<p>Because we&#39;re sending the metrics to <code>carbon-relay</code> instead of <code>carbon</code>, we have to have <code>carbon-relay</code> listen on the port that our metric collectors are sending data to. To do this, we edit entries <code>carbon.conf</code>, adding the <code>DESTINATIONS</code> entries from above, and switching the <code>LINE_RECEIVER_PORT</code> &amp; <code>PICKLE_RECEIVER_PORT</code> entries from <code>[cache]</code> and <code>[relay]</code> sections. Omitting many, many lines: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">[cache]
LINE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2003
PICKLE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2004
[relay]
LINE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2013
PICKLE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2014
</code></pre></div>
<p>Should be the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">[cache]
LINE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2013
PICKLE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2014
[relay]
DESTINATIONS = stat-sink.corp:2014, 127.0.0.1:2014
LINE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2003
PICKLE_RECEIVER_PORT = 2004
</code></pre></div>
<p>After the ports are changed and destinations added, restart <code>carbon</code> and start <code>carbon-relay</code>. Both localhost and stat-sink should begin recieving any metrics that are sent to the relay now. Hooray! With dozens of systems sending metrics to stat-sink, we can plot multiple at once and immediately see any outliers. </p>

<p>I know that Carbon and Whisper setups can get very involved, with all sorts of options around storage load balancing, but this simple 1:1 duplication turned out to be a nice way to dip our toes into the larger sea of monitoring at a bigger scale.</p>

<p>I get annoyed when I read a Twitter Direct Message in my iPhone app, and the next time I open the website, it says I have a new Direct Message. And then when I open a Twitter app on another device, it&#39;s still unread. I have to read the message over and over, even if I replied to it. How can it be 2013 and this is allowed to be the case? <strong><em>How?</em></strong></p>

<p>The pre-emptive TL;DR for this is because the way Twitter gives apps (and the website) data through its API only care about what&#39;s happening right now, and incidentally, what happened just before right now. There&#39;s just no method to say &quot;this is the last thing I read&quot; in Twitter API-ese, and the way that Direct Messages are handled make it even more complex for apps to deal with.</p>

                <p>I like to save as many emails, pictures, chat logs, and other digital ephemera of my life as I can. I like that, more than just seeing the pictures from a skydiving trip, I have all the emails, facebook statuses, and tweets that went along with the event - it makes the story richer.</p>

<p>As part of this hoarding, I  decided I wanted a details about all of Kickstarter projects I backed, and went looking for an API I could use to pull the data down. Googling and digging through the site, all the data I could find were <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats">a simple year-on-year stats page</a> and some <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/categories/data">blog posts</a> about milestones the service has hit. As it happens, Kickstarter does have an API - they just haven&#39;t opened or documented it up yet.</p>

<h2>Finding the API</h2>

<p>Because it seemed like a safe place to start, I opened https://api.kickstarter.com, assuming that there would be a registration page, or maybe some docs. Alas, all I got was</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">    <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;error_messages&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;You are not authorized to access this resource.&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="s2">&quot;http_code&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">401</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">&quot;ksr_code&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;unauthorized&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>

While I can&#39;t turn the <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/124438/Storyboard-Make-video-files-into-PDF-books">nice words</a> people said about it on metafilter or elsewhere into anything, I did work hard to add or improve things people had trouble with.

<p>The main issue I wanted to fix this time around was that of improper subtitles. Relative to other metadata about video files, the sites that support subtitles are pretty spotty. To work around this, you&#39;re presented with the list of all available subtitles that are returned for your video file. While the example below says that these are all subtitles that should work with this <em>exact</em> video file, the presence of the alternate pilot underscores the bad data that can come through.</p>

<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" src="/assets/media/storyboard/cape.gif" width="300px" />More than a few seemed to assume that Storyboard was used to create the GIFs from TV shows and movies that litter tumblr, or if it could support doing that. Well, it turns out that adding GIF support was pretty simple because Storyboard already knew when a line of text was on screen, how to extract those frames, and add subtitles to them. All that was left was saving the GIF itself, which also turned out to be pretty simple, using the same Imagemagick tools that Storyboard already required.</p>

<p>I only put a few hours of work into this, and it so it&#39;s lacking a lof of options - most notably ones that could control the size and quality of the GIF. Along with not being able to specify exact time ranges, font colors, or other options I can&#39;t think of right now, this makes the results pretty take-it-or-leave-it. Nevertheless, I can&#39;t stop laughing at the GIF on the right, and so it passes muster with me.</p>

<p>Instead of cramming more into Storyboard, I broke it out into a seperate applicaton: <strong>gifboard</strong>. Using it is pretty simple:</p>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/markolson/storyboard">Storyboard</a> was born of my insane desire to consume videos without actually having to watch them. Normally that would involve putting the TV on in the background and ignoring the video while listening to the audio, but what about the reverse? All visual without the audio. On my kindle.</p>

<p>Storyboard is <strong>very</strong> much a work in progress, though it does work for most files that it has been tested against. Right now it will only create PDFs, but ePUB and Mobi are just a few commits away. The source <a href="https://github.com/markolson/storyboard">is available on Github</a> where pull requests are gladly accepted, especially ones that deal with <a href="https://github.com/markolson/storyboard/issues">open issues.</a> Even just hearing back that Storyboard did or didn&#39;t work for a certain file can be of great help.</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>Storyboard requires Ruby 1.9.3, FFmpeg 1.1, and ImageMagick. For OSX, the <a href="https://github.com/markolson/storyboard/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL file</a> has a lot more details, but if you already have a development environment setup, you shouldn&#39;t have to do much.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">brew update &amp;&amp; brew install ffmpeg imagemagick ghostscript libtool
gem install storyboard
</code></pre></div>
<p>For Ubuntu, installing imagemagick and ghostscript from apt will work, but you need to <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/download.html">download and compile ffmpeg</a> on your own for now.</p>

<h2>Using Storyboard</h2>

<p>From a terminal, just call <code>storyboard</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">storyboard &quot;Your Video File.mkv&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Storyboard will then output a file named <code>Your Video File.pdf</code> in the directory you ran the command from. With non-HD content, this process can take just a minute or two for a 22 minute file, and the output file will be around 12MB.</p>

                <h2>SSH known_hosts and Chef</h2>

<p>A problem that the documentation for Chef&#39;s <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Deploy+Resource">Deploy_resource</a> talks about is a Chef run pausing while a program it runs waits for user input. One way this presents itself is with SSH&#39;s host fingerprint checking, which ensures that the host you&#39;re connecting to now is the same host you connected to earlier.  When first connecting to a host with anything that runs over SSH, you&#39;ll see something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">root@precise64:/tmp# git clone git@github.com:rails/rails.git
Cloning into &#39;rails&#39;...
The authenticity of host &#39;github.com (207.97.227.239)&#39; can&#39;t be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</code></pre></div>
<p>Chef can&#39;t type &#39;yes&#39; for this, and so it waits. And waits. The second issue that can come up is having a keyphrase on the SSH key. Normally, this is a very good idea, but it just doesn&#39;t work well with automated deployments because, again, it prompts for input.</p>

<p>To get around this, The Chef docs recommend creating a wrapper around SSH called <code>wrap-ssh4git.sh</code> which disables Strict Host Checking and tells SSH to use a key that has had it&#39;s keyphrase removed. While there&#39;s no <em>good</em> way to use a keyphrase protected key, we can use SSH&#39;s built in tools to add hosts to the <code>known_hosts</code> file that SSH consults when connecting.</p>

                <p>I&#39;ve been working with a lot of virtual machines lately, and using RVM to install the version of ruby I need took longer than installing the base system. If you go through the motions of <code>rvm install {VERSION}</code>, you might just gloss over this message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">No binary rubies available for: ubuntu/12.04/x86_64/{VERSION}.&lt;br /&gt;
Continuing with compilation. Please read &#39;rvm mount&#39; to get more information on binary rubies.

<p>Not reading the documentation for <code>rvm mount</code> might end up costing you a lot of time.</p>
